# EndToEndObjectDetectionProjectForSignLanguage
The goal is to develop a system that can accurately detect and interpret sign language gestures in real-time. This can help bridge communication gaps for the hearing impaired and facilitate interactions between sign language users and those who do not know the language.

## How to run:

```bash
conda create -n signLangEnv python=3.7 -y
```

```bash
conda activate signLangEnv
```


```bash
conda activate signLangEnv
```
